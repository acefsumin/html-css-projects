            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India,
                is known as the ‘Missile Man of India’ for his contribution to developing India’s missile projects,
                Prithvi and Agni missiles. He also played a significant role in developing the first indigenous
                satellite launch vehicle. Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and
                Secretary of the Defence Research and Development O
                rganisation from July 1992 to December 1999.
                From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role
                in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as
                a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam
                put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for
                transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic
                growth, and widening access to health care and education.

                A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, 2007.
                In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
                President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even
                though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party,
                the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn
                in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his
                term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.

                Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform
                India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he
                collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced
                dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.</p>
